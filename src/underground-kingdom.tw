!!Introduction to "Underground Kingdom"
This is an adventure book by Edward Packard, published by Bantam Books in the "Choose Your Own Adventure" series. I think it's number 18. I found this content on a website claiming that the content is in the public domain, so on that basis I've taken it and converted it into this playable HTML game. I found it as a decent PDF, so I've just done some text recovery and had at it.

I've changed a few things from the original, just to make it a little more relevant to modern players. That usually means that I've converted Imperial to metric measurements, fixed some writing I didn't like, and made a few other changes to make it make more sense as a playable game, not a book.

All the work of converting a PDF into this playable game is mine. I didn't write the story, but I've brought it to you like this. I hope you enjoy it.

!!WARNING!!!!
Do not read this book straight through from beginning to end! These pages contain many different adventures you can have as you try to reach the Underground Kingdom. From time to time as you read along, you will be asked to make a choice. Your choice may lead to success or to disaster! The adventures you have will be the result of the decisions you make. After you make your choice, follow the instructions to see what happens to you next.

!!SPECIAL WARNING!!!!
The Underground Kingdom is not easy to reach. Many readers never get there. Others never return.

Before starting out on your journey, you may want to read Professor Bruckner's theory, which is set forth on the pages that follow.

Professor Bruckner is a rather boring writer, and I wouldn't suggest that you bother to read his theory, except that, if you ever get to the Underground Kingdom, it might save your life.

Good luck!

!!Professor Bruckner's Theory
The discovery of the Bottomless Crevasse in Greenland by Dr. Nera Vivaldi supports my theory that the Earth is not solid, as has been thought, but that it is hollow. The Bottomless Crevasse is probably the sole route from the Earth's surface to a vast "Underground Kingdom". The only other possible link would be an underground river, flowing in alternating directions in response to the tides, but this seems unlikely.

How, you may ask, was the Earth hollowed out? My studies show that more than a billion years ago a tiny black hole collided with our planet and lodged in its centre, pulling the whole molten core into an incredibly massive sphere only a few hundred meters across. If you were to stand on the inner surface of the Earth, like a fly on the inner shell of an enormous pumpkin, you would see the black hole directly overhead, like a Black Sun.

The gravity of the Earth's thick shell would hold you to the inner shell of the Earth, though you would weigh much less than you would on the outer surface because the mass of the Black Sun would tend to pull you toward it. If there were a very tall mountain in the Underground Kingdom and you were to climb to the top of it, you might be pulled up into the Black Sun because gravity gets stronger as you approach a massive object.

In all other respects the Black Sun would not be dangerous to any creatures in the Underground Kingdom. On the contrary, the Black Sun would be necessary to life in the underworld, but in the opposite way that the sun is necessary to life on the Earth's surface. Our sun gives us heat and keeps us from freezing. The Black Sun absorbs heat. If there is an Underground Kingdom, it is the Black Sun that keeps its inhabitants from being baked to death by the heat within the Earth!

[[Begin your adventure->page0001]].

::page0001
You are standing on the Toan Glacier in northern Greenland, staring down into the black void of the crevasse. You shiver as you wonder whether you were lucky or unlucky to be invited on this expedition.

Standing next to you are Gunnar Larsen of the National Research Institute and Dr. James Sneed, a geologist. A small black box containing a signal transmitter is suspended over the crevasse by two long poles. The transmitter is wired to a console a few meters away in the ice. Dr. Sneed turns a dial as he monitors the display screen.

"Well?" Larsen's voice is impatient.

Sneed looks up, a broad smile on his face. "This is it, friends�the Bottomless Crevasse."

"Any radar return?" Larsen asks.

Sneed shakes his head. "None."

For a minute no one speaks. Like you, the others must feel excited to have reached their goal but also a little sad. It was just a year ago that your old friend, Dr. Nera Vivaldi, radioed from this spot that she had reached the Bottomless Crevasse. A few moments later, her radio went dead. She was never seen again.

Now you stand at the edge, lost in thought. How could the crevasse have no bottom? Could it really lead to an underground kingdom? What happened to Dr. Vivaldi?

But your thoughts are shattered. You didn't seem to slip, yet suddenly you are falling into the crevasse! A ledge is coming up fast beneath you. You could land on it, but you're falling so fast you're sure to be badly injured. You might only be saving yourself for a slow, agonising death.

These thoughts race through your head in a split second.

Do you [[try to land on the ledge->page0005]] or [[avoid it->page0003]]?

::page0003
Your consciousness slips away as you fall faster down, down, down.

The next thing you know, you're floating in air. In the soft, reddish light you can see that you are in a cavern, drifting toward the ceiling�or is it the floor? In a flash you realise what has happened�you've fallen to a point where gravity above you is almost equal to gravity beneath you!

You brush against a firm surface�a wall that feels like clay. You cling to it for a moment. Then you're floating again, drifting slowly down. You begin to lose your fear as you realise that gravity here is so weak that you can fall any distance without being hurt. After a while you begin to relax and enjoy drifting through a fantastic twilight world. You only wish it wasn't so hot! Closing your eyes, you try to pretend that you are safely home in bed.

[[Wait and see what happens->page0006]].

::page0005
Your whole body is racked with pain as you crash onto the ledge. You're shaken and bruised but still alive! A snowbank cushioned your fall.

"HELP!" you cry.

"Hold on!" Larsen yells. "It's going to be tricky, but we're rigging our ropes. We'll get you up."

You feel a flash of joy; then you remember something that chills you to the bone. You were very careful not to fall in. You're quite sure you didn't slip; you were pulled as if by an unknown force within the Bottomless Crevasse.

Should you warn your friends about the strange force? If you do, they may be afraid to get close enough to rescue you.

Do you [[warn Larsen and Sneed->page0013]] or do you [[keep calling for help->page0009]].

::page0006
Once again you brush against a firm surface. This time it's the floor of the cavern. In fact, you have touched down on the mossy bank of an underground stream. You drink from the cool,
clear water, then step out of the cavern into this strange world.

The only illumination is a dim red-orange glow that seems to come from the ground. The air is so clear that you can see shadowy, curving hills and valleys stretching out in all  directions, even above you.

Why do you feel so good? It must be because you are so light�you could hardly weigh more than ten or fifteen kilos. You spring to your feet Every movement is easy. You jump�almost ten meters high�and float gently to the ground.

Then you realise that you are not alone. Only a few meters away is an odd creature. As big as you are, it seems to be some kind of bird-yet much more than a bird. Under a crown of soft golden feathers are enormous blue-green eyes, so vivid and intense that they seem to be not only a means of vision, but also a means of power.

There is something terrifying about that face, but also something angelic, something that draws you to it In fact, you feel as if you are being hypnotised by those eyes�eyes of an angel bird!

Do you [[run from the strange creature->page0015]] or [[hold your ground and face it->page0010]]?

::page0007

::page0008
You run as fast as you can, hoping that once the mother sees her baby is safe, she will not pursue you.

You dart into a cavern. It's darker and hotter than the pleasant spot where you found the fledgling. Is it the same passageway you came through?

Still running, you look back over your shoulder to see if the mother bird is following. At that moment you find yourself falling, or rather rising, toward the earth's surface�drawn up into what must be the same shaft that forms the Bottomless Crevasse!

Soon you stop rising and start falling. Then you rise a shorter distance, stop, and begin to fall again. You feel like a yo-yo, bouncing up and down, up and down, until you finally come to rest at the centre of gravity, the point where you will neither rise nor fall. Like a cork thrown in the ocean, you are doomed to drift forever.

''The End''

::page0009
"Hurry!" you yell.

A moment later you see Dr. Sneed's reassuring face on one side of the opening above you. Larsen peers over the other side. "Don't worry", he calls.

"Hey, what's..." Dr. Sneed's voice is cut off as he slides over the icy lip of the crevasse. You watch with horror as his body hurtles by, down into the abyss!

You yell at Larsen to get back from the edge. But a blur whirls by, and you feel the rush of air as his body plummets after Sneed's.

They're both gone, and now you are alone, trapped on a narrow icy ledge. If only you had
warned them, you would have saved them and probably yourself too.

Now your chances look slim. A search helicopter might fly over. But will it land? Will anyone ever find you down here? Will you even survive the Arctic night?

[[Now what->page0012]]?

::page0010
You stand there and watch as the strange creature walks slowly toward you. Then you see the large, blue-white pieces of broken shell. This angel bird is only a fledgling, just hatched!

Losing your fear, you walk up and stroke the creature gently. It cocks its head to the side and touches you with one of its wings. At that moment it seems almost human.

But suddenly you hear a loud whirring sound. Hovering above you is another angel bird, a much larger one. It must be the mother of the fledgling. She swoops toward you.

Do you [[run->page0008]], [[grab the fledgling and use it as a shield->page0014]] or [[dive onto the ground and cover your face with your arms->page0011]]?

::page0011
You dive to the ground and shield your face with your arms, hoping the angel bird will leave you unharmed.

Nothing happens; the angel bird must have taken her young one away. What's more, you begin to have the feeling that you are completely safe. Slowly you get to your feet. Standing nearby are three more of the large creatures. One of them effortlessly leaves the ground, glides through the air, and lands beside you. You have a strong urge to climb on its back.

Why is it you feel so safe? The angel birds begin to make musical sounds, more beautiful than anything you've ever heard. Is it this music that causes your good feelings, or something more? These creatures seem to communicate not in words, or even ideas, but in feelings.

Without thinking more about it, you leap up, and because there's very little gravity, you almost float onto the creature's feathery back. You nestle in. It feels like a bed of goose down, soft and silky.

[[Look around you->page0016]].

::page0012
You look along the ledge. It curves up toward the surface, but it also becomes narrower. You try to gauge how close to the surface you could get without losing your footing. By cutting a couple of handholds in the ice with your pocket knife, you could make it to the top, if you don't lose your grip.

Do you [[attempt the climb->page0018]] or [[wait for rescue->page0020]]?

::page0013
"Get back from the edge!" you yell. "I didn't fall, I was pulled in!"

For a few moments you hear nothing; then Sneed yells, "Thanks for warning us. There may be some force here we don't understand. But don't worry, we're rigging a brace so we can pull you up without getting too close." 

A few minutes later you see a nylon climbing rope dangling in front of you. You pull in enough to tie around your waist and under your arms. Taking a firm grip, you call up to the top, "I'm ready�haul away!"

Your heart skips a beat as you're yanked off the ledge. You dangle for a moment; then, slowly, meter by meter, your friends pull you up over the edge. You scramble across the ice into their arms.

"Thank goodness we got you!" says Larsen.

"The Bottomless Crevasse is a killer. I think we'd better quit now."

"I agree. I've had enough", Sneed says.

After what you've been through, you're not about to argue with them. The three of you pack up and begin the long trek back across the glacier. You're happy to be alive, but you know that you'll always regret that you never reached the Underground Kingdom.

''The End''

::page0014

You lunge for the baby bird, hoping that you can use it as a shield.

Even as you move, you feel a rush of wind as the mother dives to protect her baby. You realise
that you've just made the stupidest decision of your life.

Strangely, the mother bird did not harm you. Instead, you feel that you have been put into a trance. Stranger still, you sense that something has rewound time itself, and you are being given another chance!

[[Look around you->page0010]].

::page0015
You run from the angel bird�up a hill that gets steeper and steeper. In the light gravity of the underworld you can run faster than a deer, even up this mountain. Ten, fifteen, twenty meters at a bound! You feel even lighter than you did before. You try to leap a meter in the air, but you find yourself floating. There is no way you can get down. You are entombed between the ground above and the ground below.

You close your eyes. Then, instead of feeling warm, you feel cold; instead of feeling light, you feel heavy. Instead of floating, you're lying on a hard, cold surface. Opening your eyes, you see ice walls rising above you.

''Now''' you understand. When you fell into the crevasse, you landed on this ledge, about ten meters below the surface. You must have hit your head on the ice. What a strange dream you've had! It seemed so real�as if the angel bird put the dream in your head! But there are other things to think of right now.

"HELP!" you shout.

No one answers. Larsen and Sneed have probably given you up for lost.

[[Look around you->page0012]].

::page0016
The angel bird glides through the canyons and corridors beneath the earth. It increases its speed, and you hold tight as it swoops through long, curving passageways. It's the most exciting ride of your life, and would certainly be the scariest if you didn't feel that you've never been safer.

Then, ahead of you, is a tunnel that flares out into a broad new world. An endless landscape stretches before you. It is bathed in soft, reddish light, as if the sun had just set everywhere around you!

A great river forms a curving line that divides the land. Trees line its banks. Farther back from the river are mountains, some of them lavender or blue and others that flicker like glowing embers. Strangely there is no horizon; instead the landscape fades into dusky reds and browns that curve over your head, forming a sky that is almost the same colour as the ground. Directly above you is something that looks like the sun, but it is absolutely black!

So this is the Underground Kingdom�strange, vast, and very beautiful. What people or creatures live here? What mysteries does it hold? But you are swept from your daydreaming by the realisation that your life here could be in danger.

Do you [[set out to explore the Underground Kingdom->page0019]] or do you [[decide to concentrate on getting back home safely->page0022]]?

::page0017

::page0018
You inch your way along the edge, keeping your body flat against the wall of the crevasse. You should be able to make it, as long as you don't panic. You try not to look down.

After almost an hour of slow progress, you're able to raise a hand over the rim. But you still
can't pull yourself up.

You hack away at the ice, gouging out another handhold, then another foothold. It seems like hours before you can take even one step higher. Then, with one great effort, you heave yourself over the edge, then twist and roll away from the deadly opening.

Stiff and shaky, you manage to stand and stare at the bleak world around you. The sun has set behind the western mountains, and you begin to shiver in the chill wind. You're thankful that in this part of Greenland it never grows dark in July. But it does grow cold�well below freezing�and you're too exhausted to run and jump to warm yourself.

[[Wonder what to do next->page0021]].

::page00019
You know how you feel: the risks don't matter. You want to explore the Underground Kingdom!

The angel bird seems to understand. Steeply banking, it swoops down along the great river and glides gently onto a mossy plain. Nearby is a grove of tall trees. Short stumpy branches with clusters of multicoloured leaves thrust out from their trunks. They look almost like hands  holding bunches of flowers.

You slide to the ground, and at once the angel bird rises in the air. As it glides up into the dark red sky, you feel a wave of happiness. You follow its path with your eyes long after it has disappeared. Then, turning to survey the strange landscape, you wonder where you will go. What dangers await you?

[[Continue exploring->page0048]].

::page20
You decide not to risk the treacherous climb to the surface. Surely help is on the way. You huddle on the icy ledge, stamping your feet and clapping your hands, trying to keep warm. You feel your body temperature dropping. You've got to stay awake until a search party arrives.

The hours pass slowly. The sun dips below the horizon, but there is still light in the sky. Straining, you think you hear something... Pocka pocka pocka pocka pocka... overhead. A helicopter is hovering over the crevasse! For a moment you're blinded by a searchlight. The helicopter drops to just a few yards above you. The crew lowers a harness. Eagerly you grab it and buckle it around you.

"HOLD ON. WE'RE PULLING YOU UP." they announce over the PA. You're suddenly yanked into the air. Moments later a pair of hands pulls you through the hatch. The pilot pours you a cup of hot chocolate from his Thermos.

"Thanks for staying alive till we got here", he says with a grin.

You soon feel life seeping back into your body. "Thanks for pulling me out!"

"This is the one place in the world everyone should stay away from", the pilot says.

"Nothing could get me back here", you say.

''The End''
<<click "Would you like to play again?">><<script>>state.restart()<</script>><</click>>

::page0021
There is no shelter from the relentless wind and no sign of Larsen or Sneed. It's getting hard to breathe. You soon begin to feel the dull aches, stiffness, and sick feeling you've read about�the dread symptoms of hypothermia; you are freezing to death. Maybe a search helicopter will arrive any moment. Maybe in a few hours. Maybe never.

You are very tired. You desperately need rest.

Do you [[huddle in your parka and try to conserve your strength->page0032]] or do you [[push through and keep on walking->page0025]]?

::page0022
Your strongest desire now is to be home again. You cling tightly to the angel bird. As if it knows what you're thinking, it rises in the air, banks steeply, and then, accelerating, hurtles into a corridor within the ground. You nestle into its thick downy coat as it streaks through the darkness. All the while you feel completely safe, and in time you sleep.

When you awake, it is much colder. A chill wind bites against your body. The brightness of the world around you is not the warm red light of the Underground Kingdom, but the cold white light of the Arctic. The barren landscape, pocketed with ice and snow, is a familiar scene, as is the rude village of shacks and tin-roofed buildings nearby. You're in Greenland! The village is the coastal settlement from which your party began its trek across the ice fields to the Bottomless Crevasse.

As you trudge across the frozen slope to the village, you think about the angel bird and the Underground Kingdom, and you think how much more there must be in the universe, and even on our own planet, than we can ever imagine.

''The End''

::page0024
"There's no chance of that", Professor Bruckner's assistant tells you. "An aerial photograph taken a few weeks ago showed that the glacier has moved, sealing the crevasse with 6,000 feet of solid ice."

You hang up the phone and stand by the window, thinking about the world that lies beneath the Earth's surface. What is it like? What creatures might live there? What happened to Professor Bruckner? Did he find Larsen and Sneed? Is Dr. Vivaldi still alive? Now, of course, you'll never know.

''The End''
<<click "Would you like to play again?">><<script>>state.restart()<</script>><</click>>

::page0025
You force yourself to keep walking. If you wander too far from the crevasse, a search team
might miss you, so you walk in a large square: fifty paces north, then fifty east, then fifty south, and then fifty west, to close the square. You go around and around. Your legs feel like lead. Your eyes are half shut. You hardly notice when the weak arctic sun reappears ... the sun... you can't think... dizzy... you can't stand...

It seems like another world when you wake up in a room with pale green walls and gleaming tile floors. Your head is swimming. What happened to Larsen and Sneed? You feel as if you've lived through a nightmare.

"You're lucky, we were able to save your legs." A tall, bearded doctor is speaking. "You'll be OK." Then his voice trails off as he tells you that your friends, Gunnar Larsen and Dr. Sneed, have joined Dr. Vivaldi, all lost forever.

"Larsen... Sneed." You keep mumbling their names until finally sleep comes.

By morning your head has cleared. It was a terrible ordeal, but at least you survived. In a few weeks you'll be home�home for good, because nothing could ever persuade you to go near the Bottomless Crevasse again!

[[Go home->page0026]].

::page26
Three months have passed. You return home late one afternoon to find a man you don't recognise waiting at your front door.

"I'm Professor Bruckner. From the National Research Institute in London." He shakes your hand warmly.

"Please come in. Are you still studying the Bottomless Crevasse?"

Bruckner nods. "We've identified the force that may have pulled Larsen and Sneed into the crevasse. Would you be willing to go back? Precautions would be taken so there would be no chance of its happening again."

You shake your head. "I'm afraid not, Professor. I don't think I could go back to the place where my friends died."

Smiling, the professor leans toward you. "Would it change your mind if I told you that your
friends may still be alive?" 

"What?"

"It's true. We received faint radio signals from a point far beneath the earth's surface. I believe that one or more of the others must be alive somewhere in the Underground Kingdom, and we have the means to reach them. Now will you come?"

Do you [[agree to go on the new expedition->page0028]] or [[turn down another trip into danger->page0030]]?

::page28
"Professor Bruckner, count me in!"

"Good", he says. "This time we'll be far better equipped. NPL has put two helicopters at my disposal. One of them will transport our party of scientists and technicians. The other will carry the Vertacraft, a rocket-propelled capsule specifically designed for this mission."

[[Prepare for your trip->page0029]].


::page0029
Three weeks later you find yourself staring once again at the Bottomless Crevasse.

"It looks narrower than when I was here before", you remark.

"Yes", Bruckner says, "the glacier has been advancing about a meter a year. It won't be long before the crevasse is completely sealed."

While you and the other members of the party stand at a safe distance, the Professor cautiously walks to the rim of the crevasse. In one hand he holds an oblong instrument that emits an increasingly rapid clicking.

"Don't get too close!" you shout.

"Indeed." Bruckner takes a few steps back. "I think I know what happened to Larsen, Sneed, and Vivaldi."

"What?"

"Gravity waves coming from the centre of the Earth have disrupted space-time enough to pull them in." The professor looks down into your puzzled face. "And you, as well", he adds. "I've always suspected that the laws of physics may be different in the vicinity of a black hole. Now we have proof!"

"What does this mean?"

The professor smiles. "It means that the interior of the earth�beginning about 1300 kilometres below the surface�is hollow."

[[Think about that->page0075]].

::page30
"No, thank you, Professor", you say. "I've seen enough. I never want to get near the Bottomless Crevasse again."

Bruckner shrugs. "I understand", he says as he holds out his hand.


From then on, you follow the news eagerly, hoping to hear some report on Professor Bruckner's expedition. One day, passing a newspaper stand, you see a headline that makes your heart sink:
PROFESSOR AND PARTY MISSING IN WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS ICE FIELDS!

In the months that follow you hear nothing further about the Bottomless Crevasse, until one night, watching the news, you hear an interview with two scientists who claim to have picked up radio signals coming from inside the earth. "We can't explain their seemingly impossible origin", one of them reports, "nor can we decipher the message, except for two words, All Safe."

The next morning you phone Professor Bruckner's office at the National Physical Laboratory. "I was wondering whether there were any plans for another expedition to the Bottomless Crevasse", you say.

[[Listen carefully->page0024]].

::page0032
You huddle in your parka, but the cruel wind penetrates your body. You feel yourself growing numb. You try to stand up, but your legs won't move. You feel as if you are drifting through time and space. Then you feel nothing at all.

The search and rescue team eventually found your lifeless body. They were never able to locate Larsen and Sneed. A few days later a memorial service was held for the brave people who lost their lives exploring the Bottomless Crevasse. Everyone spoke very highly of you.

''The End''

::page0033
"All right", says Bruckner, "if no one will volunteer, I'll go alone." The rest of you help position the Vertacraft over the crevasse and wish him well as he snaps the hatch shut and releases the craft into free-fall.

Frank Crouter, Bruckner's assistant, glances at his watch. "If he survives, we'll get a signal back within ten minutes", he says.

You all wait anxiously, watching the clock, watching the crevasse. Ten minutes go by, fifteen, twenty, twenty-five. A chilling wind bites through your parka. You kick the icy ground.

"Thirty minutes", says Crouter. "There's no way..."

Weary and sad, your party trudges back across the ice fields. The moving glacier is rapidly closing the crevasse. There won't be another chance.

''The End''
<<click "Would you like to play again?">><<script>>state.restart()<</script>><</click>>

::page0035
You know that your chances of surviving the expedition are slim. Even if you safely descend into the Bottomless Crevasse, there's no assurance that the Vertacraft will be able to get you out again. Still, it's your only chance to find your lost friends and to explore a new world.

You grit your teeth and climb aboard. The Professor climbs in beside you.

"Ready?" he says. "I'm going to activate us as soon as we're centred."

"Ready." You strap yourself in and say a prayer. You feel like a larva inside a cocoon.

Looking through the port, you watch the others position the Vertacraft over the crevasse. You wave at them, and they wave back. Suddenly you are falling�faster and faster, plummeting toward the centre of the earth. Has the Professor lost control?

"Professor Bruckner!" you yell. "Won't the rockets work? Can't you slow us?"

"We're saving our fuel", he shouts. "Gravity will slow us�you'll see."

Has he gone mad? You notice a red button on the control panel. Next to it is a sign that reads:

''EMERGENCY REVERSE/RETURN TO INITIAL POSITION.''

[[Stare at the red button->page0037]].

::page0036
You and Dr. Vivaldi cross the Great River and start your trek to the Shining Mountains. Along the way your guide, Mopur, brings back mountain game, breadbush, and tanga.

The air seems lighter and brighter than in the valley of the Great River. Never have you felt so happy as you do right now�hiking through the Shining Mountains.

But your Archpod guide grumbles and frets. He blinks and rubs his eyes.

[[Keep walking->page0092]].

::page0037
Thanks to the dual control system, it looks as if you have a chance to escape this madness. Still, you can't be sure it will save you...

Do you [[push the red Emergency Reverse button->page0089]] or [[try to talk to Dr. Bruckner again->page0038]]?

::page0038
"We're going too fast! Can't we slow down?" you call.

"No. We have hundreds of miles to go. We've got to get through the earth's mantle fast, or we'll be baked to death." Bruckner's voice is cool and reassuring. Maybe he knows what he's doing.

But every minute, the temperature rises. You begin to sweat. Whatever made you think you
could survive such a trip? Sipping cold water from a plastic bottle, you try to close your eyes and relax. Then it seems as if the Vertacraft is slowing, but you can't be sure.

Suddenly everything is still. The Vertacraft has come to rest. Looking through a porthole, you see that you have landed inside a large crater. Slowly you climb out of the Vertacraft and open the other compartment. Professor Bruckner's face is ashen grey. You feel for his pulse. Nothing. The strain of the descent must have been too much for his heart.

[[Look around you->page0043]].

::page0039
You could probably climb a nearby tree and hide among the clusters of giant leaves. But is it wise to run like a frightened animal? Maybe things will go better for you if you bravely face the inhabitants of this world.

Do you [[face the creatures->page0042]] or [[hide in a nearby cluster-leaf tree->page0046]].

The scene around you reminds you of a photographic negative. All the shades and colours seem reversed. The ground is greyish pink clay with white outcroppings. In the distance you can see areas that glow like beds of hot coals. Nearby is a forest of trees with green trunks and white leaves. The trees are short; yet their branches, taking advantage of the light gravity, spread out for hundreds of feet in all directions.

You climb a small hill to get a better view. Wherever you look, the land curves upward, as if you were standing in the bottom of an enormous bowl. The sky is covered with what looks like reddish yellow clouds.

Most amazing of all is the sight directly overhead—a disc almost the size of the sun; but, instead of shining brightly, it is absolutely black. You can feel its coolness, as if it were drawing heat from your skin. It's the black hole at the centre of the earth!

You turn sharply at the sound of chattering. Coming up the ravine are more than a dozen creatures, smaller than you, yet walking upright on two legs. Half human, half ape, they look like creatures that might have once lived on the earth's surface. They are carrying ropes and nets.

[[Watch the creatures carefully->page0039]].

::page42
You step forward to meet the strange procession. The underworld creatures form a circle around you, cackling and gesturing to each other.

You smile and hold out your arms. "Hello" you begin, but the creatures raise their nets and close in on you. One of them barks an order. They motion for you to follow them. You don't have much choice. Despite their small size, they move rapidly through the thick woods.  Occasionally they freeze, and you hear them whispering: "Kota, ib saben Kota."

You march a mile or so through groves of trees. It's as hot as you've ever known it, and you feel as if you're going to faint, but finally you reach open land. Instantly you feel cooler. The Black Sun is drawing heat from your body.

Soon you reach a village of igloo-shaped structures that look as if they're made of green clay. One of your captors leads you to the nearest one. "Ib agon," he says as he takes you inside.

[[Follow the creature into the hut->page0044]].

::page0043
You bury the Professor's body near the Vertacraft, and say a prayer. You feel sad and afraid of setting forth alone in a strange world. But there is no choice. You must search for food and shelter.

First, you've got to get out of this crater. There is a tunnel nearby. Peering inside, you see that it leads straight down. Suddenly you realise that it was through this tunnel that the Vertacraft travelled; you're looking through the other end of the Bottomless Crevasse. The tunnel doesn't lead straight down, but straight up—to the surface of the earth!

So Professor Bruckner was right. The earth is like a hollowed-out melon, and you're standing on its inner shell. Your feet must be held to the ground by the gravity of the shell itself.

You look around at the walls of the crater. They are too steep to climb. But you feel so light—as if you were walking on the moon—you might be able to jump out.

You stand there a minute, wondering why the pull of gravity here isn't as strong as it is on the earth's surface. Then you remember the rest of Bruckner's theory: There is a black hole at the centre of the earth, pulling you toward it. You leap as high as you can—twenty feet in the air! Then, with one great bound, you're out, standing on the surface of the Underground Kingdom.

[[Look around you->page0040]].

::page0044
The interior of the agon, as it seems to be called, is lit by glowing stones circling the inner wall. In the centre is a small fountain. Clear water bubbles forth and flows along a silver trough before disappearing underground. The floor is soft and spongy, like a thick bed of moss.

The leader steps forward. "Ket," he says, pointing to himself. "Ket Raka." Pointing to the
others, he says, "Akim Raka, Tor Raka..."

You repeat each name, then pointing to yourself, tell them your name. The Rakas laugh as they try to pronounce the strange sound.

Tor, who seems younger than the others, brings you something that looks like cheese but tastes
like honey. Ket gives you a small pink fruit. "Ib tanga," he says, smiling.

Tanga is delicious, and you are eating a second one when a large blue-furred Raka rushes into
the agon. Pointing at you, he speaks excitedly in his own tongue. Tor begins to argue with him. The others join in.

"Nar mg calla!" the blue-furred Raka says loudly. It's clear he wants you to come with him; it
seems likely that he represents the chief, or leader.

Ket and Akim gesture as if you should obey. But Tor shakes his head, warning you not to go.

Do you [[follow the blue-furred Raka->page0048]] or do you [[refuse to go->page0050]]?

::page0046
You hide in the cluster-leaf tree. The strange creatures pass by except for one straggler, who
stops to stretch. For a moment he looks right at you. "Kota zaark!" he cries, then turns and runs after the others.

Perhaps you needn't have been so cautious. The creature looked more like a frightened animal than a fierce hunter.

As you climb down from the tree, you hear a low moaning coming from the brush. A pair of bright blue lights is shining from within the darkness.

Now the moaning comes from behind you. Turning, you see another pair of blue lights. Beneath them are long, glistening fangs. Slowly the creatures close in on you; their moans rise into high-pitched shrieks. What are they?

You have only a few seconds to live, so it hardly matters.

::page0048
Hoping for the best, you follow the blue-furred Raka to the centre of the village. As you walk along the narrow footpaths, other Rakas emerge from their agons and stare at you curiously.

When you reach the central agon the blue-furred Raka lets out a long, low hooting noise, which is answered from within. Inside an old white-headed Raka sits near the central fountain. A large black disc hangs from his neck. For a long time he stares at you. Finally he rises and steps closer. "So, you are what my hunters found. My name is Arton. I am the High Raka of the village of Rakmara."

You are so startled by the familiar words that it takes you a minute to answer. "How is it you speak my language?" you finally ask.

Arton smiles. "A visitor from the Nether World. She called herself Nera."

"Dr. Vivaldi? She's ''alive''? Where is she?"

The old Raka shakes his head. "She tried to swim across the Great River. The river spirits have swallowed her."

"She might have made it across!" you say.

"Even if she did, the Archpods would have fed her to the Kota beasts."

"What are Archpods?"

"The Archpods live beyond the Great River. For a long time the Rakas and Archpods have each had one hunting boat; that is the law. Now the Archpods build many boats. They are not hunting boats; they are war boats. The Archpods plan to conquer Rakmara."

You hold your head in your hands. Poor Dr. Vivaldi! And now the Kingdom faces the threat of war.

[[Think about this->page0051]].

::page50
You shake your head and stand your ground. The blue-furred Raka glares at you and strides from the agon. He returns a few moments later with two other Rakas, each holding ropes and a net.

"I won't be taken captive like some animal!" you shout.

A Raka tries to rope you, but you duck out of reach. They draw closer. Like a football quarterback, you spin and dart past them.

"Kela! Zaark!" the Rakas yell, but you're already out of the agon, running across the dimly lit land.

Helped by the light gravity, you quickly reach a grove of cluster-leaf trees, and you keep running, on and on. At last you reach the open countryside. In the soft reddish grey twilight you see the Great River just ahead. You stop to rest beside its waters.

[[Rest up->page0053]].

::page0051
"Yes, bad times are upon us," Arton continues. "But we shall protect ourselves. We have learned to mix powders and call up the fire of the earth in a great blast of noise and heat"

"You mean bombs?"

"We call them brakpa. With brakpa and with your help, we shall destroy the Archpods before
they destroy us."

"What do you mean, 'with my help'?" you ask.

"You come from the Nether World, where war is the way of life. If you ride with us, our warriors will have courage."

"What are the Kota beasts?"

"You ask too many questions!" the High Raka snaps back. "Now you must answer mine: Will you go with our warriors to attack the Archpods?"

You shrink back from the choice. The High Raka's voice grows stern and cold "If you are not with us, then you are against us, and we shall deal with you as our enemy."

Do you [[tell the High Raka that you will go with his warriors->page0052]] or do you [[tell him that you won't take part in a war->page0056]].

::page52
"I'll go with your warriors," you answer.

"Very well," says Alton. "You will stay with Tomo. Vivaldi taught him English, and he will tell you what you need to know."

Immediately one of the Rakas steps forward and takes your arm. "I am Tomo," he says. Then he leads you to the outskirts of the village and into his agon. He brings you woven mats. "You must rest now," he says.

You peer outside at the red-streaked sky. "Doesn't it ever get dark here?"

"We have no night or day," says Tomo. "We measure time by the tides of the Great River. Dr. Vivaldi said two of our tides equal one of your days. It is sleeping tide now."

You realise that you have not slept since you arrived in the Underground Kingdom. How long have you been here? How many tides? Too tired to think about it, you lie down and quickly fall asleep.

[[Sleep->page0054]].

::page0053
Once you've caught your breath, you walk along the river bank and soon reach a crude wooden dock. Two Rakas are guarding their hunting boat, a long flat-bottomed shell fashioned from duster-leaf wood. Nearby is a smaller boat, one you could paddle yourself. You just might be able to untie it, push off, and get across the river before the guards catch you.

Do you [[try to take the small boat and make a break for the other side->page0057]] or do you [[try to bluff the guards into thinking you have permission to use it->page0058]].

::page54
When you wake, Tomo gives you a bright pink tanga. You hadn't realised how little you've eaten, and you wolf it down. Smiling, Tomo replaces it with another.

"Someday we will go hunting," says Tomo.

"Are you a hunter?"

"Almost. I must first go on the Hunt of the Black Sun. I must kill a Kota beast."

"A Kota beast? What are they?"

Tomo frowns. "Great toothed animals, with eyes like blue flames and teeth like iron fangs. They live in the darkest, hottest parts of the woods. They tear anything apart, even themselves."

You start to ask about the Hunt of the Black Sun, but Tomo raises a hand. "Now we must talk of war. The Archpods will not expect an attack when the river is low. That is when we shall cross and destroy their boats."


The next morning as the Great River begins to fall, the Rakas load their hunting boat, now called the war boat, with brakpa—crude bombs packed in hollowed logs. You shudder to think that you are about to witness the beginning of a war. But there seems to be no way to avoid it Before the sleeping tide has ended, Tomo, you, and five hunters set off in the war boat.

The Raka hunters are clumsy at rowing, and the boat is so heavy that a few small waves would easily swamp it. You realise you might be able to swim to shore before the Rakas could turn around and catch you. It's risky, but it's your only chance to avoid the war!

Do you [[dive overboard and swim for shore->page0061]] or do you [[wait in the war boat->page0062]]?

::page0056
"I won't have anything to do with your brakpa," you say. "I am not an enemy of you or of the Archpods."

"Ig krig zaark!" the High Raka says angrily.

Two Raka guards seize you and march you out of the agon. But the moment you get outside, you make a break. You've always been able to run fast when you needed to. In the light gravity, you're even faster. As you dart through the groves of duster-leaf trees, you can hear the cries of the Rakas from both sides and behind you. But the Great River lies just ahead, and for once you're in luck—there's a crude raft tied up along the shore. You quickly untie it, and push off as you jump aboard. The current soon takes you around a bend in the river and safely out of sight.

You lie low on the raft, afraid of landing until you are well past Rakmara. Now you have time to think. Where will the river take you? What will be your fate?

[[Ponder your fate->page0063]].

::page0057
You quickly reach the boat, but you can't untie the rope! Instantly the Rakas are upon you. Uttering angry cries, they fling their nets over you. One of them blindfolds you. Then they march you along a winding, bumpy path.

"Where are you taking me?" you ask. But the Rakas ignore you, muttering angrily in their language.

Death seems certain. How will they execute you? They seem to like ropes; maybe they will hang you.

As you march on, hour after hour, the air turns colder. You feel your strength ebbing.

Finally the Rakas stop. Exhausted, you crumple to the ground. All is silent, and you fall into a deep sleep.

[[Sleep->page0060]].

::page0058

You think fast. Luckily, you remember the command that the blue-furred Raka gave. You walk up to the guards, smiling. You point in the direction you came from, then to yourself, and then to one of the boats.

"Nar mg calla," you say with authority.

The guards mutter. Then, to your surprise, they smile. One of them unties a boat and motions for you to board it. They must think you're a privileged guest of the High Raka. You quickly get aboard and push off.

As the current takes you around a bend, you notice Archpod settlements on the opposite shore. Soon you spot a good landing place. As you get closer, you notice a band of Archpods standing on the shore. Like the first Rakas you met, they are armed with ropes and nets. They don't look very friendly. You could be in for more trouble than you had with the Rakas.

Do you [[head for the shore->page0066]] or [[head back across the river->page0065]].

::page0059

::page0060
Hours later you awake, stiff and shaking from the cold. Cautiously you pull off your blindfold. Your captors are gone. All around you is dark brown clay. There are no trees, no water, and no shelter from the cold wind that blows across the vast, empty plain. So this is your intended fate—you will be left to die of exposure under the Black Sun.

It's a long trek across the desert of the Underground Kingdom, but if you can only reach some trees, you may be able to find a warm place to rest. Somehow you know that you'll make it, if
you have the will.

Do you?

::page0061
In a flash you're over the side and swimming for shore. The Rakas yell at you. One of them tries to hit you with an oar while the others stroke furiously, trying to turn their unwilling craft around.

Swimming hard, you hear screams behind you. The war boat has overturned! The brakpa have gone to the bottom, and the Rakas are struggling to save their lives and right the boat. Using all your strength, you swim in to shore and start running for the groves of duster-leaf trees.

Almost at once you hear a loud, trilling song. Above you is an enormous flying creature with
wings stretching twenty feet across! You stare into its great blue-green eyes and at once feel completely safe. You know you've seen it, or at least dreamed of seeing it, before. It's like some kind of angel bird sent to protect you. Without thinking, you leap right onto the creature's back.

[[Hang on->page0022]]!

::page0062
Swimming to shore looks too risky. You sit quietly in the boat, hoping for the best. As the war boat nears the middle of the river, the current gets stronger. The Raka warriors can hardly row against it As the Rakas struggle with their oars, the boat is swept farther and farther downstream.

You wonder where the current will take you, until you hear a sound up ahead that quickly grows into a roar.

"Ig riba!" the Rakas shout. "Ig zaark!" They begin to unload the heavy brakpa. Frantically you help, but at the sight of the boiling white rapids ahead, you lose heart. Moments later the boat smashes into the rocks, and you and the Raka warriors are swept away by the raging torrent.

::page0063
Your raft floats on past marshy banks and yellow clay islands. The river grows narrow as it flows through a deep canyon. Rock cliffs rise up on both sides. You hold on, hoping to reach a place where you can land.

Never have you experienced as dark a night as this. It's as if the river were flowing through a tunnel somewhere in the depths of the earth.

Finally you sleep, and it seems as if a very long time has passed when you awake and find your raft pitching up and down. Why has the river grown so rough? It's still too dark to see much, but at least the stars are out.

Stars? There aren't any stars in the Underground Kingdom. You're not on the river—you're
on an ocean!

So, the Great River must be an underground link between the earth's seas. The tides were with you, and carried you through the earth's mantle and crust to the surface. There's land nearby. And you notice a faint glow on the horizon. Soon the sun will be rising, not the cold Black Sun of the Underground Kingdom, but your own warm, bright, life-giving sun!

You try to row back to the Rakmara shore, but the current is now so swift that you find yourself being carried downstream. Desperately you try to paddle against it It's no use. And there's bad trouble up ahead—foaming, white rapids! You hang on for your life, but your raft smashes into a rock with a terrific thunk. One end tilts straight up, dumping you into the wild, swirling waters. You try to grab the raft, but you can't reach it. You start swimming toward shore, but you can't make any headway.

You're not a quitter. You'll go down trying.

::page0066
Trying to act unafraid, you row straight in to shore, hop out of the boat, and step forward to meet the Archpods. "Hello. I come as a friend!" you call out. But their only response is to take you prisoner and march you back to their village.

You soon find that the Archpods live in agons similar to those of the Rakas. Your captors lead you into the largest one, where you expect to be presented to their chief. Instead, a woman calls your name. It's Dr. Vivaldi!

She hugs you warmly. "I thought I'd never see another human face!" she cries, tears streaming
down her cheeks.

One of the guards says something you cannot understand. Then the Archpods march out of the agon, leaving you alone with your friend.

Dr. Vivaldi tells you how she barely survived her fall through the Bottomless Crevasse, how she lived for almost a year with the Rakas and finally swam across the Great River to the land of the Archpods. You tell her of your descent to the Underground Kingdom and your adventures in Rakmara.

"We must make a plan," she says. "The Archpods have learned that the Rakas are making bombs. They think we may be Raka spies. That is why you were treated so rudely. They have told me that their chief, the Grand Akpar, will soon decide whether to execute us."

[[Ponder->page0068]]...

::page0068

"What can we do?" you ask.

Dr. Vivaldi looks at you thoughtfully, then says, "If there is a war, we cannot expect to survive. I am going to talk to the Grand Akpar. But here, take my gold bracelet. If you give it to the guard, he will let you escape."

"But what will happen to you? I don't want to leave you here. I'll go to the Grand Akpar with you!"

Dr. Vivaldi replies, "Think carefully before you make such a decision."

Do you [[face the Grand Akpar with Dr. Vivaldi->page0070]] or do you [[escape while you have a chance->page0100]].

::page0069
You're glad that your friends are still alive, and you hurry to meet them. A few minutes later you are exchanging stories of your adventures in the Underground Kingdom. But Larsen and Sneed do not seem happy.

"Is anything wrong?" Dr. Vivaldi finally asks them.

"I'm afraid so," Larsen replies. "We've just inspected the Bottomless Crevasse. The glacier has sealed it tight. We are trapped here forever!"

"We'll never get home now," you say.

"That's the way it looks," says Larsen. "Like it or not, we're pioneers. The only thing for us to do is to make the best of our lives in this new world."

"That's not good enough for me," says Dr. Vivaldi. "We're going to find a way out of here!" She looks at you with a broad smile. "Right?"

"Right," you answer.
